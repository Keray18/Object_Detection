# Face_Mask_Detection
Created a Machine Learning model on a Multi-Class Classification problem. The data used here is from Kaggle's Face_Mask images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaykumar1799/face-mask-detection .

## Build Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Model
> Build neural networks for multiple models(experimental) and also used transfer learning for the last model.
> Did Data Augmentation
> Finall model saved was created using Transfer Learning (EfficientNet) model.


# Under Development
