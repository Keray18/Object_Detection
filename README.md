# Face_Mask_Detection
> Created a Machine Learning model on a Multi-Class Classification problem. The data used here is from Kaggle's Face_Mask images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaykumar1799/face-mask-detection 

## Build Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Model
* Build neural networks for multiple models(experimental) and also used transfer learning for the last model.
* Did Data Augmentation To lower the validation loss and increase the accuracy.
* Final model saved was created using Transfer Learning (EfficientNet) model.


# Under Development
